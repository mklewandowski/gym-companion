# Gym Companion
Gym Companion is a small mobile application that I made in an hour while joking with my sister about the incredible amount of effort that folks put into making various loud noises at the gym. I thought it might save energy to have an app that could generate all those grunty, weight clanging noises at the simple press of a button.
